    <h2>Sunset Park</h2>
    <p>I live near Sunset Park and it's a nice place to play or relax. There is a great view of Manhattan on one side and a public swimming pool for the summer on the other.</p>
    <p>It also has a playground, basketball court, and soccer field that you can play in. It's mostly pretty clean and theres a lot of options to choose to have fun.</p>

    <h3>Subways</h3>
    <p>The subway has a terrible piss smell in some places and it's very old. I recently went to China for vacation and their subway was many times better than NYC's.</p>
    <p>At least the subway does it's job, although not that well since there's quite a bit of delays sometimes.</p>
